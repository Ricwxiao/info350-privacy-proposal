                        Businesses are collecting data from our mobile phones. Besides providing customers better service according to their previous data, Max Freedman unveils that businesses may also sell the data to gain revenue. Different types of data are collected using mobile applications; for example, location-based advertisements are presented on users' phones as they technically track internet-connected devices' IP addresses. Also, as advertisers value the data, companies may sell it to gain significant profits (Freedman, 2023).

                        Based on this circumstance of mobile applications, some governments have taken actions to protect their citizens’ information security. One of the relevant works is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a EU law about data protection and privacy. GDPR provides legal protection for EU users to delete information and have more control over the data collected about them (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016). Our project focuses on how people - especially young adults (mainly university students) - can protect their privacy when accessing mobile applications. To be rigorous and professional, GDPR, as an officially recognized support, is an excellent reference to check companies' jurisdiction, people's fundamental rights, and restrictions.

                        In addition to legal support, mobile application users can take some practical and easy steps in advance. From the New York Times, one suggestion for protecting privacy besides location and password settings is “Configure Siri Setting.” Siri is not just what we think of as a voice assistant; it also makes suggestions based on how users access their phones. Siri is not as simple as we think; for example, it can extract keywords from the text of the users' diaries. Klosowski suggests that disabling learning from this app and showing app search functions in the Siri setting can contribute to controlling some private information (Klosowski, 2022). Klosowski's work intuitively demonstrates some reasonable protecting approaches with reasons. As we will make the zine as a deliverable to demonstrate to people the issue and, most importantly, to help them realize how to master personal data, it is one of the models.
