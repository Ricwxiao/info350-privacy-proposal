            <h2>Introduction & Overview</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Project Idea and Final Deliverable</h3>
                <p>
                    Our final project idea is to find out people's opinions on the privacy infringement issues due to the training and implementation of AI. Because we are in an era of AI, our personal data could be easily taken as a part of input in AI modeling. Some people think that this issue is remote from their life, or they don't care if their data is collected aggregately or anonymously. Others consider this as a severe aggression to their privacy. Besides collecting points of view from both sides, we also want to interview “professionals” of privacy infringement opponents about how people can avoid the infringement if they think it matters. Our proposed final deliverable would be a brochure or zine. I could even be a website if we have enough time to do coding. In summary, we are going to deliver our findings and conclusions in as many graphics as possible. We need to visualize our data to give people a better understanding of the whole issue.

                <h3>Reason and Expected Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    As we discussed in class, privacy is important to individuals and society. AI is just one aspect of the expanding technology's infringement on personal rights nowadays, but the most data hungry one. Despite the tremendous benefit it brings to us, we cannot forget that our privacy is just as important as technology advancement. Therefore, we want to inform people about their situation under the context of AI and privacy, as well as to educate them on some ways they could protect themselves.

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>
                    We are trying to reach people who have little knowledge about AI or privacy. If they don't care about privacy, we would like to convince them of the significance of privacy. If they care about privacy, they might be happy to learn about the ways we provide to protect their privacy.

                    <h3>Summary of Relevant Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Businesses are collecting data from our mobile phones. Besides providing customers better service according to their previous data, Max Freedman unveils that businesses may also sell the data to gain revenue. Different types of data are collected using mobile applications; for example, location-based advertisements are presented on users' phones as they technically track internet-connected devices' IP addresses. Also, as advertisers value the data, companies may sell it to gain significant profits (Freedman, 2023).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on this circumstance of mobile applications, some governments have taken actions to protect their citizens’ information security. One of the relevant works is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a EU law about data protection and privacy. GDPR provides legal protection for EU users to delete information and have more control over the data collected about them (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016). Our project focuses on how people - especially young adults (mainly university students) - can protect their privacy when accessing mobile applications. To be rigorous and professional, GDPR, as an officially recognized support, is an excellent reference to check companies' jurisdiction, people's fundamental rights, and restrictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to legal support, mobile application users can take some practical and easy steps in advance. From the New York Times, one suggestion for protecting privacy besides location and password settings is “Configure Siri Setting.” Siri is not just what we think of as a voice assistant; it also makes suggestions based on how users access their phones. Siri is not as simple as we think; for example, it can extract keywords from the text of the users' diaries. Klosowski suggests that disabling learning from this app and showing app search functions in the Siri setting can contribute to controlling some private information (Klosowski, 2022). Klosowski's work intuitively demonstrates some reasonable protecting approaches with reasons. As we will make the zine as a deliverable to demonstrate to people the issue and, most importantly, to help them realize how to master personal data, it is one of the models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important work in a related area is the response to AI discussed in privacy legislation (Division, 2007); there are two main forms of this work that are relevant to our project: 1. directly targeting discrimination; and 2. indirectly addressing risk (Augustin, 2019). First, artificial intelligence is trained based on user data and self-models, which can cause privacy and even discrimination concerns. When developers create training models with algorithmic discrimination, it is easy to gather data that is harmful to users, particularly members of minority populations such as people of color, women, religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and individuals with disabilities. Privacy laws may be discussed directly with minorities whose privacy has been compromised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second is to address risks more indirectly (Augustin, 2019). Many organizations and companies, as well as some lawmakers, have proposed this accountability system in response to the privacy issues brought about by artificial intelligence; they propose that algorithms can be made more transparent and allow for better risk assessment. Because we are trying to reach out to those who have their own unique insights into AI or privacy, we can ask their opinions on improving this kind of scheme by telling them both ways and conducting data collection for our final deliverables.
